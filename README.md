## Main

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':    # If file is not imported, this will be executed
    main()
```

## Basic and necessary commands needed to execute a well-defined python code at the command line.

### Opening a python shell.

```python
$ python3
```

### Installing a package

```python
$ pip3 install <package-name>
```

### Running a python script

```python
$ python3 <filename>.py
```

### Calculating the time of execution

```python
$ time python3 <filename>.py
```

### Importing a py script

```python
import <filename>
```

## Getting started with the language

### Basic I/O

- Input

```python
input("Input: ")
```

- Output
  Python automatically points the cursor to a new line.
  We need not specify explicitly.

```python
print("Output")
```

### Variables and Constants

In python, we need not specify the datatype of a variable.
The interpreter interprets the value and assigns a suitabe datatype for that.

```python
number = 0
org = "GitHub"
```

### Conditional Statements

In python, we do not write a block of code in a pair of paranthesis.
We write it after `:` followed by an indentation in the next line.

The conditional statements include `if`, `if-else`, `nested if` and so on...

```python
x,y = 0,1
if x < y:
  print("x is less than y")
else:
  print("x is not less than y")
```

Note that the colon (:) following <expr> is required.
Similarly, the `nested if` also works.

### Iterative statements

As other programming languages, we have

- `for loop`

```python
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```

The `range` function starts off with 0 till the number(excluded).

- `while loop`

```python
i=0
while(i < 10):
  print("{} is less than 10".format(i))
  i += 1
```

### String formatting

There are a few ways to format a string in Python.

- Using the `%` operator
  Strings can be formatted using the % operator:

```python
>>> foo = 'world'
>>> 'Hello %s' % foo
'Hello world'
```

To subsitute multiple instances, wrap the right hand side in a Tuple:

```python
>>> foo = 'James'
>>> bar = 'Nancy'
>>> 'Hi, my name is %s and this is %s' % (foo, bar)
'Hi, my name is James and this is Nancy'
```

You can also do variable subsitutions with a dictionary:

```python
>>> dict = { "name": "Mike", "country": "Canada" }
>>> 'I am %(name)s and I am from %(country)s' % dict
'I am Mike and I am from Canada'
```

- `.format()`

Introduced in Python 3, but is available in Python 2.7+

```python
>>> 'Hello {}'.format('world')
'Hello world'
```

Similar to the above, subsitutions can be referred by name:

```python
>>> 'Hi {name}, your total is ${total}'.format(name='Bob', total=5.50)
'Hi Bob, your total is $5.5'
```

- f-Strings

Available in Python 3.6+. Works similar to the above, but is more powerful as arbitrary Python expressions can be embedded:

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 10
>>> f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.'
'Five plus ten is 15 and not 30.'
```

## Function

Function is a block of code which runs when it is called.  
Functions are declared using the `def` keyword. Function name must be a valid identifier.  
Function arguments can be literal values, variables (valid identifiers), and expressions.

```python
def sum(a, b) :
	return a + b

def subtract(a, b) :
	return a - b

def getPerson(name, age) :
	person = { "name": name, "age": age }
	return person
```

### Function Call

Functions can be called by passing the arguments according to the declaration.

```python
a = 20
b = 50
c = sum(a, b)
d = sum(b, 50)
e = subtract(b, a)
p = getPerson("Joe", 25)

# OUTPUT:
print( "Sum - {} plus {}: {}" . format( a, b, c ) ) # Sum - 20 plus 50: 70
print( "Sum - {} plus 50: {}" . format( b, d ) ) # Sum - 50 plus 50: 100
print( "Subtraction - {} minus {}: {}" . format( b, a, e ) ) # Subtraction - 50 minus 20: 30
print( "Person - {}" . format( p ) ) # Person - {'name': 'Joe', 'age': 75}
```

### Function as Object

All data in a Python is represented by objects. There’s nothing particularly special about functions. They’re also just objects.

```python
def yell(text):                   # Define function yell
	return text.upper() + '!'


>>> bark = yell                   # Declare an object "bark" that contains the function "yell"
>>> bark('woof')                  # You could now execute the "yell" function object by calling bark
'WOOF!'
```

### Nested Function

Functions can be defined inside other functions. These are often called nested functions or inner functions.

```python
def speak(text):                          # Define function speak
	def wisper(t):                    # Function wisper does not exist outside speak
		return t.lower() + '...'
	return wisper(text)


>>> speak('Hello, World')
'hello, world...'
```

## Lambda

The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions.

```python
>>> add = lambda x, y: x + y
>>> add(5, 3)
8
```

You could declare the same add function with the def keyword, but it would be slightly more verbose:

```python
def add(x, y):
	return x + y
>>> add(5, 3)
8
```

## Data Structures

### Lists

```python
# These are all inplace operations returns a None value

<list>.append(<ele>)            # Add an element to the end of the list
<list>.sort()                   # Sorts the given list
<list>.pop([<ele>])             # Removes the last element if no argument else removes the element at the index given
<list>.clear()                  # Makes it an empty list
<list>.insert(<index>, <ele>)   # Adds the element before the index
<list>.extend(<iterator>)
<list>.reverse()                # Reverse a given list
```

```python
# These are not inplace operations and has a return value

<list>.copy()                   # Makes a shallow copy of the list
<list>.index(<ele>)             # Returns the index of the given element
<list>.count(<ele>)             # Returns the number of occurrences of the element
```

### Dictionaries

key-value pairs.

```python
<dict> = {'Google':100, 'Facebook':80, 'Apple':90}

<dict>['Amazon'] = 85                           # Adding a key along with the value

# Accessing the dictionary
for key in <dict>:
  print("{key} -> {x}".format(key=key, x=<dict>[key]))

<dict>.keys()                                   # Print all the keys
<dict>.values()                                 # Print all the values
len(<dict>)                                     # Find the length of the dictionary
<dict>.pop(<key>)                               # Removes the item with the specified key name
<dict>.copy()                                   # Make a copy of a dictionary
```

A dictionary can also contain many dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.

### Tuple

A tuple is a collection which is ordered, indexed and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

```python
this_tuple = ('books', 'pen', 'paper')          # Defined a tuple

# Accessing Tuple Items
print(this_tuple[2])                            # paper
```

#### Changing Tuple Values

Tuples are immutable, which means they cant to changed once they are created.  
If a value inside tuple needs to be changed, the tuple must be converted to a list.  
Newly created list can be converted back to tuple after updating changes.

```python
desk_tuple = ("pen stand", "plant", "marker")
desk_list = list(desk_tuple)
desk_list[2] = "highlighter"
desk_tuple = tuple(desk_list)

print(desk_tuple[2])                            # highlighter
```

#### Creating tuple with one item

To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

```python
this_tuple = ("Python",)
print(type(this_tuple))                         # tuple

# NOT a tuple
this_tuple = ("Python")
print(type(this_tuple))                         # str
```

#### Deleting a tuple

Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can delete the tuple completely:

```python
this_tuple = ('books', 'pen', 'paper')
del this_tuple
print(this_tuple)                               # ERROR: this_tuple is not defined
## Third party libraries
```

## Pandas

```shell
$ sudo pip3 install pandas          # Installing pandas module in Ubuntu
```

```python
import pandas as pd

<dataframe>.head([<n>])             # Display the first n rows of the Dataframe, default value is 5 rows
<dataframe>.tail([<n>])             # Display the last n rows of the Dataframe, default value is 5 rows
<dataframe>.info()                  # Gives some information like, row and column datatypes, non-null count, and memory usage
<dataframe>.describe()              # Provides some descriptive statistics about the numerical rows in the dataframe
```

### Data Structures in Pandas

In Pandas, total of three data structures are used

- Series
- DataFrame
- Panel

```python
#Series
sr = pd.Series([100, 200, 300, 400],
index=["red", "green", "yello", "black"])
print(sr)
print(sr.values)
print(sr.index)

#A series class has a structure that allows you to give values in one-dimensional arrays an index that corresponds to each value.
```

```python
#DataFrame
values = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
index = ['one', 'two', 'three']
columns = ['A', 'B', 'C']

df = pd.DataFrame(values, index=index, columns=columns)
print(df)
print(df.index)
print(df.columns)
print(df.values)
#DataFrame passes a two-dimensional list as a parameter. Compared to a series, a data frame is added up to columns, consisting of columns, indexes, and values.
```

## NLTK

```shell
$ sudo pip3 install nltk                    # Installing nltk module in Ubuntu
```

```python
import nltk

# Before trying any function download the word list
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

## Errors and Exceptions

Program stops working on error Python raises exceptions when it encounter error.  
To avoid this, `try-catch` blocks are used.

### Exceptions

No syntax errors found, program starts execution.  
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.  
Use try: except: finally: to catch and handle the exceptions.  
Use try: except: finally: to avoid program termination on exceptions.  
Use try: except: else: instead of try: except: finally: for alternate flows.  
Multiple except can be use to catch the exceptions.

```python
a = 10 * (1/0)

# Throws division by zero exception and terminate the program
# Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
    a = 10 * (1/0)
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Updated Program - Valid - Try: Except: Finally
b = 10
try:
    a = 10 * (1/b)
    print( "a = {}" .format( a ) )
except:
    print( "Caught divide by zero - while getting a" )
    print( "Execute on error - b must be non-zero value" )
finally:
    print( "Execute Always - normal and exceptional flow" )

# OUTPUT
a = 1.0
Execute Always - normal and exceptional flow

## Updated Program - Error - Try: Except: Finally
b = 0
try:
    a = 10 * (1/b)
    print( "a = {}" .format( a ) )
except:
    print( "Caught divide by zero - while getting a" )
    print( "Execute on error - b must be non-zero value" )
else:
    print( "Alternate to exceptional flow" )

# Output
Caught divide by zero - while getting a
Execute on error - b must be non-zero value
Execute Always - normal and exceptional flow
```

## Python Snippets

### Anagrams

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

```python
from collections import Counter
def anagram(first, second):
    return Counter(first) == Counter(second)
anagram("abcd3", "3acdb") # True
```

### Memory

This snippet can be used to check the memory usage of an object.

```python
import sys

variable = 30
print(sys.getsizeof(variable)) # 24
```

### Print a string N times

This snippet can be used to print a string n times without having to use loops to do it.

```python
n = 2
s ="Programming"
print(s * n) # ProgrammingProgramming
```

### Chunk

This method chunks a list into smaller lists of a specified size.

```python
def chunk(list, size):
    return [list[i:i+size] for i in range(0,len(list), size)]
```

### Get vowels

This method gets vowels (‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’) found in a string.

```python
def get_vowels(string):
    return [each for each in string if each in 'aeiou']
get_vowels('foobar') # ['o', 'o', 'a']
get_vowels('gym') # []
```

### Length of Last Word in a string

This method gets the length of last word in a given string.

```python
def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        if(s.split()):
            lst=s.split()
            last=lst[-1]
            return len(last)
        return 0
```

### Valid Palindrome

This method returns a bool value specifying whether a string is palindromic or not.

```python
def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = [ x.lower() for x in s if x.isalnum() ]
        return s == s[::-1]
```

### Check Lowercase

This method checks if a string is in lower case or not.

```python
def toLowerCase(self, str):
        """
        :type str: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        return str.lower()
```

### Count Negatives in a sorted Matrix

This method returns the count of negative numbers in a sorted matrix.

```python
def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for num in grid:
            for n in num:
                if n < 0:
                    count += 1
        return count
```

### Write to file

This method takes in the `name of file` and `content` then write the content into the file. If the file doesn't exist then it creates the file.

```python
def write_to_file(filename, content):
  try:
    with open(filename, "w+") as f:
      f.write(content)
    print("Written to file successfully.")
  except Exception as e:
    print("Failed to write to file with error: ")
    print(e)
```

### Median of given array

This method returns the median of the given list/array as an output.

```python
import statistics
def median(arr):
    print(statistics.median(arr))
```

### Even or Odd

This function determines the given number is even or odd.

```python
def find_Evenodd(num):

    if(num%2==0):
        print(num," Is an even")
    else:
        print(num," is an odd")
```

### Palindrome

This function returns "yes" if given string is a palindrome, else "no". Palindrome is a string whose reverse is the string itself.

```python
def isPalindrome(s):
    if (s == s[::-1]):
        return "yes"
    else:
        return "no"
```
